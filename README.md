# A C++ library for complex matrices

This repository provides simple tools for working with complex
matrices. It has similar structure as python. It is written in
C++ from scratch and contains three well-known  algorithms for
solving linear systems of equations:
 * Conjugate gradient method,
 * Steepest descent method,
 * Jacobi method.
