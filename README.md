This repository provides simple tools for working with complex
matrices. It has similar structure as python. It is written in
C++ from scratch and contains three well-known  algorithms for
solving linear systems of equations:
 1. Conjugate gradient method,
 2. Steepest descent method,
 3. Jacobi method.
